setting CO2 emission performance standards for new heavy-duty vehicles and amending Regulations (EC) No 595/2009 and (EU) 2018/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Directive 96/53/EC
This Regulation, together with Regulation (EU) 2019/631 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), provides a clear pathway for CO2 emissions reductions from the road transport sector and contributes to the binding target of at least a 40 % domestic reduction in economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990, as was endorsed in the conclusions of the European Council of 23-24 October 2014, and approved by the Council on 6 March 2015 as the ‘Union Intended Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement’.
CO2 emissions reduction targets for the Union-wide fleets of new heavy-duty vehicles should therefore be set for 2025 and for 2030, taking into account the vehicle fleet renewal time and the need for the road transport sector to contribute to the Union climate and energy targets for 2030 and beyond. Such a stepwise approach also provides a clear and early signal for the industry to accelerate the market introduction of energy efficient technologies and zero- and low-emission heavy-duty vehicles. The deployment of zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles should also contribute to addressing urban mobility problems. While it is essential to reduce CO2 emissions from road transport, the promotion of such heavy-duty vehicles by manufacturers is also important for the effective reduction of air pollutants and excessive noise levels in cities and urban areas.
In defining the CO2 emissions reduction levels that should be achieved by the Union fleet of heavy-duty vehicles, account should be taken of the effectiveness of those reduction levels in delivering a cost-effective contribution to reducing the CO2 emissions of the sectors covered by Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) by 2030, of the resulting costs and savings for society, manufacturers, transport operators, consumers, as well as of their direct and indirect implications for employment, innovation and co-benefits generated in terms of reduced air pollution and improved energy security.
A new procedure for determining the CO2 emissions and fuel consumption of individual heavy-duty vehicles has been introduced as part of the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/2400 (6) provides a methodology, based on the VECTO tool, through which the CO2 emissions and fuel consumption of whole heavy-duty vehicles can be simulated. That methodology allows the diversity of the heavy-duty vehicle sector and the high degree of customisation of individual heavy-duty vehicles to be taken into account. As a first step, from 1 July 2019, the CO2 emissions are determined for four groups of heavy-duty vehicles that account for around 65 % to 70 % of all CO2 emissions from the Union fleet of heavy-duty vehicles.
The CO2 emissions data determined pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/2400 are to be monitored under Regulation (EU) 2018/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). Those data should form the basis for determining the CO2 emissions reduction targets to be achieved by the four groups of the most emitting heavy-duty vehicles in the Union, as well as for determining a manufacturer’s average specific CO2 emissions in a given reporting period.
A CO2 emissions reduction target should be set for 2025 as a relative reduction based on the average CO2 emissions of those heavy-duty vehicles that were newly registered in the period from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020, reflecting the deployment of readily available cost-effective technologies for conventional vehicles. For 2030 onwards, a CO2 emissions reduction target should also be set. That target should apply unless decided otherwise pursuant to the review to be carried out in 2022. The 2030 target should be assessed in accordance with the European Union commitments under the Paris Agreement.
To ensure the robustness of the reference CO2 emissions against increasing CO2 emissions of heavy-duty vehicles by undue procedural means, which would not be representative for a situation where CO2 emissions are already regulated, it is appropriate to provide a methodology for correcting the reference CO2 emissions where necessary.
In calculating the reference CO2 emissions serving as the basis for determining the 2025 and 2030 specific CO2 emissions targets, the expected CO2 emissions reduction potential of the heavy-duty fleet should be taken into account. It is therefore appropriate to exclude vocational vehicles, such as vehicles used for garbage collection or construction works, from that calculation. Those vehicles have a comparatively low mileage, and due to their specific driving pattern, technical measures for reducing CO2 emissions and fuel consumption do not appear to be as cost effective in the same way as they are for heavy-duty vehicles used for the delivery of goods.
The CO2 emissions reduction requirements should be expressed in grams of CO2 per tonne kilometre to reflect the utility of the heavy-duty vehicles.
A fair distribution of the overall CO2 emissions reduction requirements among the manufacturers needs to be ensured, taking into account the diversity of heavy-duty vehicles in terms of their design and driving pattern, annual mileage, payload and trailer configuration. It is therefore appropriate to distinguish the heavy-duty vehicles according to different and separate vehicle sub-groups that reflect the vehicles’ typical usage pattern and specific technical characteristics. By setting annual manufacturer specific CO2 emissions targets as a weighted average of the targets defined for each such vehicle sub-group, manufacturers are also given the means to effectively balance a possible underperformance of vehicles in certain vehicle sub-groups with an overachievement in other vehicle sub-groups, taking into account the average lifetime CO2 emissions of vehicles in the different vehicle sub-groups.
In order to ensure the smooth transition towards zero-emission mobility and to provide incentives for the development and deployment on the Union market of zero- and low-emission heavy-duty vehicles that would complement demand-side instruments, such as Directive 2009/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), a dedicated mechanism in the form of super credits should be introduced for the reporting periods before 2025 and a benchmark for the share of zero- and low-emission heavy-duty vehicles in a manufacturer’s fleet should be set for the reporting periods as from 2025.
For the purpose of calculating the average specific CO2 emissions of a manufacturer, in the reporting periods prior to 2025, all zero- and low-emission heavy-duty vehicles should be counted multiple times. For the reporting periods as from 2025, the average specific CO2 emissions of a manufacturer should be calculated taking into account its performance against the benchmark of zero- and low-emission heavy-duty vehicles. The level of incentives should vary according to the actual CO2 emissions of the vehicle. In order to avoid a weakening of the environmental objectives, the resulting CO2 emissions reduction should be subject to a cap.
In order to promote a cost-effective implementation of the CO2 emissions reduction requirements, while taking into account fluctuations in the heavy-duty vehicles fleet composition and CO2 emissions over the years, manufacturers should have the possibility of balancing their overachievement in complying with their specific CO2 emissions target in one year with an underperformance in another year.
In order to achieve the CO2 emissions reductions pursuant to this Regulation, the CO2 emissions of heavy-duty vehicles in use should be in conformity with the values determined pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 and its implementing measures. It should therefore be possible for the Commission to take into account, in the calculation of the average specific CO2 emissions of a manufacturer, any systematic non-conformity found by type-approval authorities with regard to the CO2 emissions of heavy-duty vehicles in use.
In order to be in a position to take such measures, the Commission should have the powers to establish and implement a procedure for verifying the correspondence between the CO2 emissions of heavy-duty vehicles in-service as determined in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 and its implementing measures, and the CO2 emission values recorded in the certificates of conformity, individual approval certificates or customer information files. In developing that procedure, particular consideration should be given to identifying methods, including the use of data from on-board fuel and/or energy consumption monitoring devices, for detecting strategies through which a vehicle’s CO2 performance is artificially improved in the certification procedure. Where deviations or strategies that artificially improve a vehicle’s CO2 performance are found in the course of such verifications, those findings are to be considered as sufficient reason to suspect that there is a serious risk of non-compliance with the requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 and in Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10), and Member States should, on that basis, take the necessary measures pursuant to Chapter XI of Regulation (EU) 2018/858.
The effectiveness of the CO2 emissions targets set out in this Regulation is strongly dependent on the real-world representativeness of the methodology used for determining the CO2 emissions. In line with the 2016 Opinion of the Scientific Advice Mechanism (SAM) as regards light-duty vehicles, and the recommendation of the European Parliament following its inquiry into emission measurements in the automotive sector, it is appropriate also in the case of heavy-duty vehicles to put in place a mechanism to assess the real-world representativeness of the CO2 emission and energy consumption values determined pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/2400. The most reliable way to ensure the real-world representativeness of those values is by using data from the on-board fuel and/or energy consumption monitoring devices. The Commission should therefore have the powers to develop the procedures needed for collecting and processing fuel and energy consumption data required for making such assessments and to ensure the public availability of such data, whilst providing for the protection of any personal data.
In 2022, the Commission should assess the effectiveness of the CO2 emission performance standards laid down in this Regulation and in particular the level of the CO2 emissions reduction target to be achieved by 2030, the modalities that should be available for achieving that target and beyond, as well as the setting of CO2 emissions reduction targets for other types of heavy-duty vehicles, such as smaller lorries, vocational vehicles, buses, coaches and trailers. That assessment should also include, strictly for the purpose of this Regulation, considerations of heavy-duty vehicles and vehicle combinations, taking into account weights and dimensions applicable to national transport, for example modular and intermodal concepts, while also assessing possible transport safety and efficiency aspects, intermodal, environmental, infrastructural and rebound effects as well as the geographical situation of Member States.
It is important to assess the full life-cycle CO2 emissions from heavy-duty vehicles at Union level. To that end, the Commission should evaluate not later than 2023 the possibility of developing a common Union methodology for the assessment and the consistent data reporting of the full life-cycle CO2 emissions of heavy-duty vehicles that are placed on the Union market. The Commission should adopt follow-up measures, including, where appropriate, legislative proposals.
In order to ensure that the specific CO2 emissions of heavy-duty vehicles remain representative and fully up-to-date, amendments to Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 and its implementing measures that affect those specific CO2 emissions, need to be reflected in this Regulation. For that purpose, the Commission should have the powers to determine a methodology for defining a representative heavy-duty vehicle for each vehicle sub-group, on the basis of which changes of the specific CO2 emissions should be assessed.
In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers in relation to identifying vehicles that are certified as vocational vehicles and applying corrections to the annual average specific CO2 emissions of a manufacturer, collecting excess CO2 emissions premiums, reporting deviations in CO2 emissions values and taking them into account in the calculation of the average specific CO2 emissions, assessing the application of the conditions under which the reference CO2 emissions have been determined and the criteria to determine whether those emissions have been unduly increased and, if so, how they are to be corrected, ensuring that certain parameters relating to real world CO2 emissions and energy consumption of heavy-duty vehicles are made available to the Commission, performing verifications that the CO2 emission and fuel consumption values in the customer information files correspond to the CO2 emission from and fuel consumption of heavy-duty vehicles in-service and on the presence of strategies to artificially improve the vehicle’s performance in the tests performed or in calculations made, and defining one or more representative vehicles of a vehicle sub-group on the basis of which a payload adjustment is to be determined, should be conferred on the Commission. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 595/2009, implementing powers in relation to determining certain aspects of the environmental performance of vehicles of categories M2, M3, N2, N3, O3 and O4 should be conferred on the Commission. The implementing powers referred to in this recital should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11).
In order to amend or supplement non-essential elements of the provisions of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of adjusting the reference CO2 emissions, in respect of setting out the guiding principles and criteria to define the procedures to verify CO2 emissions of heavy-duty vehicles in-service and in respect of amending the Annexes to this Regulation as regards certain technical parameters, including the mission profile weights, the payload values, the annual mileage values and the payload adjustment factors. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (12). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council should receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts should systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.
In order to contribute to achieving the Union’s target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 % below 2005 levels in 2030 in the sectors covered by Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2018/842 and to achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement, and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, this Regulation sets CO2 emission performance requirements for new heavy-duty vehicles whereby the specific CO2 emissions of the Union fleet of new heavy-duty vehicles shall be reduced compared to the reference CO2 emissions as follows:
The reference CO2 emissions shall be based on the monitoring data reported pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/956 for the period from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020 (‘the reference period’), excluding vocational vehicles, and shall be calculated in accordance with point 3 of Annex I to this Regulation.
1.   This Regulation shall apply to new heavy-duty vehicles of categories N2 and N3 that meet the following characteristics:
It shall also apply, for the purposes of Article 5 of, and point 2.3 of Annex I to, this Regulation, to new heavy-duty vehicles of category N that do not fall within the scope of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) and do not meet the characteristics set out in points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph.
3.   The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, adopt a specific procedure for identifying heavy-duty vehicles that are certified as vocational vehicles pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 and its implementing measures but are not registered as such, and shall apply corrections to the annual average specific CO2 emissions of a manufacturer to take those vehicles into account, starting from the reporting period of the year 2021 and for each subsequent reporting period. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16(2) of this Regulation.
‘reference CO2 emissions’ means the average of the specific CO2 emissions in the reference period referred to in the second paragraph of Article 1 of all new heavy-duty vehicles in each of the vehicle sub-groups, excluding vocational vehicles, determined in accordance with point 3 of Annex I;
‘specific CO2 emissions’ means the CO2 emissions of an individual heavy-duty vehicle determined in accordance with point 2.1 of Annex I;
‘average specific CO2 emissions’ means the average of the specific CO2 emissions of a manufacturer’s new heavy-duty vehicles in a given reporting period determined in accordance with point 2.7 of Annex I;
Starting from 1 July 2020, and in each subsequent reporting period, the Commission shall determine for each manufacturer the average specific CO2 emissions in g/tkm for the preceding reporting period, by taking the following into account:
1.   Starting from 1 July 2020 and for each subsequent reporting period, the Commission shall determine for each manufacturer the zero- and low-emission factor for the preceding reporting period.
The zero- and low-emission factor shall take into account the number and the CO2 emissions of zero- and low-emission heavy-duty vehicles in the manufacturer’s fleet in a reporting period, including zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 2(1), as well as zero- and low-emission vocational vehicles and shall be determined in accordance with point 2.3 of Annex I.
2.   For the reporting periods 2019 to 2024, the zero- and low-emission heavy-duty vehicles shall be counted as follows for the purposes of paragraph 1:
a low-emission heavy-duty vehicle shall be counted as up to two vehicles according to a function of its specific CO2 emissions and the low-emission threshold of the vehicle sub-group to which the vehicle belongs as defined in point 2.3.3 of Annex I.
3.   For the reporting periods from 2025, onwards the zero- and low-emission factor shall be determined on the basis of a 2 % benchmark in accordance with point 2.3.2 of Annex I.
4.   The zero- and low-emission factor shall reduce the average specific CO2 emissions of a manufacturer by a maximum of 3 %. The contribution of the zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 2(1) to that factor shall reduce the average specific CO2 emissions of a manufacturer by a maximum of 1,5 %.
Specific CO2 emissions targets of a manufacturer
Starting from 1 July 2026 and in each subsequent reporting period, the Commission shall determine for each manufacturer a specific CO2 emissions target for the preceding reporting period. That specific CO2 emissions target shall be the sum, over all vehicle sub-groups, of the products of the following values:
the CO2 emissions reduction target referred to in point (a) or (b) of the first paragraph of Article 1, as applicable;
1.   For the purpose of determining a manufacturer’s compliance with its specific CO2 emissions targets in the reporting periods of the years 2025 to 2029, account shall be taken of its emission credits or emission debts determined in accordance with point 5 of Annex I, which correspond to the number of new heavy-duty vehicles, excluding vocational vehicles, of the manufacturer in a reporting period, multiplied by:
2.   The CO2 emissions reduction trajectory shall be set for each manufacturer in accordance with point 5.1 of Annex I, based on a linear trajectory between the reference CO2 emissions referred to in the second paragraph of Article 1 and the CO2 emissions target for the reporting period of the year 2025 as specified in point (a) of the first paragraph of that Article, and between the CO2 emissions target for the reporting period of the year 2025 and the CO2 emissions target for the reporting periods of the year 2030 onwards as specified in point (b) of the first paragraph of that Article.
1.   Where a manufacturer is found, pursuant to paragraph 2, to have excess CO2 emissions in a given reporting period from 2025 onwards, the Commission shall impose an excess CO2 emissions premium, calculated in accordance with the following formula:
where, in any of the reporting periods of the years 2025 to 2028, the sum of the emission debts reduced by the sum of the emission credits exceeds the emission debt limit referred to in the third subparagraph of Article 7(1);
3.   The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, determine the means for collecting excess CO2 emissions premiums under paragraph 1 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16(2).
1.   Type-approval authorities shall, without delay, report to the Commission any deviations in the CO2 emission values of heavy-duty vehicles in service as compared to the values that are indicated in certificates of conformity or in the customer information file referred to in Article 9(4) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2400 as a result of verifications performed in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 13 of this Regulation.
2.   The Commission shall take the deviations referred to in paragraph 1 into account for the purpose of calculating the average specific CO2 emissions of a manufacturer.
3.   The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, adopt detailed rules on the procedures for reporting such deviations and for taking them into account in the calculation of the average specific CO2 emissions. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16(2).
In order to ensure the robustness and representativeness of the reference CO2 emissions as a basis for determining the Union fleet-wide CO2 emissions targets, the Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, establish the methodology for assessing the application of the conditions under which the reference CO2 emissions have been determined and establish the criteria to determine whether those emissions have been unduly increased and, if so, how they are to be corrected.
from 1 July 2020, for each manufacturer, its average specific CO2 emissions in the preceding reporting period, as referred to in Article 4;
from 1 July 2020, for each manufacturer, its zero- and low-emission factor in the preceding reporting period, as referred to in Article 5(1);
from 1 July 2026, for each manufacturer, its specific CO2 emissions target for the preceding reporting period, as referred to in Article 6;
from 1 July 2020 until 30 June 2031, for each manufacturer, its CO2 emissions reduction trajectory, its emission credits and, from 1 July 2026 until 30 June 2031, its emission debts in the preceding reporting period, as referred to in Article 7;
from 1 July 2026, for each manufacturer, its excess CO2 emissions in the preceding reporting period, as referred to in Article 8(1);
from 1 July 2020, the average specific CO2 emissions of all new heavy-duty vehicles registered in the Union in the preceding reporting period.
2.   The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 17 to adjust the reference CO2 emissions in accordance with the following:
where adjustment factors have been determined pursuant to Article 14(2), by applying those adjustment factors to the reference CO2 emissions;
where an undue increase in the reference CO2 emissions has been determined in accordance with the methodology referred to in Article 10, by correcting the reference CO2 emissions by 30 April 2022.
The Commission shall publish the adjusted reference CO2 emissions values and shall apply those values for the calculation of the manufacturer specific CO2 emissions targets applicable in the reporting periods starting from the date of application of the delegated acts adjusting the values.
1.   The Commission shall monitor and assess the real-world representativeness of the CO2 emissions and energy consumption values determined within the framework of Regulation (EC) No 595/2009.
Furthermore, the Commission shall regularly collect data on the real-world CO2 emissions and energy consumption of heavy-duty vehicles using on-board fuel and/or energy consumption monitoring devices, starting with new heavy-duty vehicles registered from the date of application of the measures referred to in point (b) of Article 5c of Regulation (EC) No 595/2009.
2.   For the purpose of paragraph 1 of this Article, the Commission shall ensure that the following parameters relating to real-world CO2 emissions and energy consumption of heavy-duty vehicles are made available to it at regular intervals, starting from the date of application of the measures referred to in point (b) of Article 5c of Regulation (EC) No 595/2009, by manufacturers, national authorities or through direct data transfer from vehicles, as the case may be:
3.   In order to prevent the real-world emissions gap from growing, the Commission shall, not later than two years and five months following the date of application of the measures referred to in point (b) of Article 5c of Regulation (EC) No 595/2009, assess how fuel and energy consumption data may be used to ensure that the vehicle CO2 emission and energy consumption values determined pursuant to that Regulation remain representative of real-world emissions over time for each manufacturer.
The Commission shall monitor and report annually on how the gap referred to in the first subparagraph evolves, and shall, with a view to preventing an increase in that gap, assess, in 2027, the feasibility of a mechanism to adjust the manufacturer’s average specific CO2 emissions as of 2030, and, if appropriate, submit a legislative proposal to put such a mechanism in place.
Verification of the CO2 emissions of heavy-duty vehicles in-service
1.   Manufacturers shall ensure that the CO2 emission and fuel consumption values recorded in the customer information file referred to in Article 9(4) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2400 correspond to the CO2 emissions from and fuel consumption of heavy-duty vehicles in-service as determined in accordance with that Regulation.
2.   Following the entry into force of the procedures referred to in paragraph 4, type-approval authorities shall verify, for those manufacturers to which they have granted a licence to operate the simulation tool in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 and its implementing measures, on the basis of appropriate and representative vehicle samples, that the CO2 emission and fuel consumption values recorded in the customer information files correspond to the CO2 emissions from and fuel consumption of heavy-duty vehicles in-service as determined in accordance with that Regulation and its implementing measures, while considering, inter alia, using available data from on-board fuel and/or energy consumption monitoring devices.
3.   Where a lack of correspondence of CO2 emission and fuel consumption values which cannot be attributed to a malfunctioning of the simulation tool, or the presence of any strategies artificially improving a vehicle’s performance, is found as a result of the verifications performed pursuant to paragraph 2, the responsible type-approval authority shall, in addition to taking the necessary measures set out in Chapter XI of Regulation (EU) 2018/858, ensure that the customer information files, the certificates of conformity and the individual approval certificates are corrected, as the case may be.
1.   In order to ensure that the technical parameters used for the calculation of the average specific CO2 emissions of a manufacturer pursuant to Article 4 and the calculation of the specific CO2 emissions targets pursuant to Article 6 take into account technical progress and the evolution of freight transport logistics, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 17 to amend the following provisions set out in Annexes I and II:
2.   Where the type-approval procedures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 595/2009 and its implementing measures are modified by amendments other than those referred to in points (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 of this Article in such a way that the level of the CO2 emissions of the representative vehicles defined pursuant to this paragraph increase or decrease by more than 5 g CO2/km, the Commission shall, in accordance with point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 11(2), apply an adjustment factor to the reference CO2 emissions that is to be calculated in accordance with the formula set out in point 2 of Annex II.
3.   The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, establish a methodology for defining one or more representative vehicles of a vehicle sub-group, including their statistical weightings, on the basis of which the adjustment referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be determined, taking into account the monitoring data reported pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/956 and the technical characteristics of the vehicles listed in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2400. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure set out in Article 16(2) of this Regulation.
1.   By 31 December 2022, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the effectiveness of this Regulation, on the CO2 emissions reduction target and the level of the incentive mechanism for zero- and low-emission heavy-duty vehicles applicable from 2030, on setting CO2 emissions reduction targets for other types of heavy-duty vehicles, including trailers, buses and coaches, and vocational vehicles, and on the introduction of binding CO2 emissions reduction targets for heavy-duty vehicles for 2035 and 2040 onwards. The 2030 target shall be assessed in accordance with the European Union commitments under the Paris Agreement.

an assessment of the effectiveness of the incentive mechanism for zero- and low-emission heavy-duty vehicles set out in Article 5 and the appropriateness of its different elements, with a view to adjusting it for the period after 2025 towards a possible differentiation by zero-emission driving range and vehicle sub-group, combined with mileage payload weighting factors, with a date of application that provides at least three years of lead time;
an assessment of the roll-out of the necessary recharging and refuelling infrastructure, of the possibility of introducing engine CO2 emission performance standards, in particular for vocational vehicles, and of the real-world representativeness of the CO2 emission and fuel consumption values determined in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/2400;
4.   As part of the evaluation pursuant to Article 15(5) of Regulation (EU) 2019/631, the Commission shall evaluate the possibility to assign the revenues from the excess CO2 emissions premiums to a specific fund or a relevant programme, with the objective of ensuring a just transition towards a climate-neutral economy as referred to in Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement, in particular to support re-skilling, up-skilling and other skills training and reallocation of workers in the automotive sector in all affected Member States, in particular in the regions and the communities most affected by the transition. The Commission shall, if appropriate, submit a legislative proposal to that effect by 2027 at the latest.
5.   The Commission shall, not later than 2023, evaluate the possibility of developing a common Union methodology for the assessment, and the consistent data reporting, of the full life-cycle CO2 emissions of new heavy-duty vehicles that are placed on the Union market. The Commission shall transmit that evaluation, including where appropriate proposals for follow-up measures, such as legislative proposals, to the European Parliament and to the Council.
the influence of those vehicles on the CO2 emissions, fuel consumption, electric consumption and zero-emission driving range of motor vehicles is determined in accordance with the methodology referred to in point (a) of Article 5c;
They shall also ensure that the zero-emission driving range and electricity consumption of those vehicles are determined in accordance with the methodology referred to in point (c) of Article 5c.
