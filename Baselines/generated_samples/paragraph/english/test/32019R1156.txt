REGULATION (EU) 2019/1156 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
on facilitating cross-border distribution of collective investment undertakings and amending Regulations (EU) No 345/2013, (EU) No 346/2013 and (EU) No 1286/2014
Marketing communications addressed to investors in AIFs and UCITS should specify where, how and in which language investors can obtain summarised information on investor rights and they should clearly state that the AIFM, the EuVECA manager, the EuSEF manager or the UCITS management company (together, ‘managers of collective investment undertakings’), has the right to terminate the arrangements made for marketing.
In order to increase transparency and investor protection and facilitate access to information on national laws and regulations and administrative provisions applicable to marketing communications, competent authorities should publish such texts on their websites in, as a minimum, a language customary in the sphere of international finance, including their non-official summaries which would allow managers of collective investment undertakings to get a broad overview of those laws, regulations and administrative provisions. The publication should only be for information purposes and should not create legal obligations. For the same reasons, the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) (ESMA) should create a central database containing summaries of national requirements for marketing communications and hyperlinks to the information published on the websites of competent authorities.
In order to promote good practices of investor protection which are enshrined in the national requirements for fair and clear marketing communications, including on-line aspects of such marketing communications, ESMA should issue guidelines on the application of those requirements for marketing communications.
Competent authorities should be able to require prior notification of marketing communications for the purpose of ex-ante verification of compliance of those communications with this Regulation and other applicable requirements, such as whether the marketing communications are identifiable as such, whether they describe the risks and rewards of purchasing units of a UCITS and, where a Member State allows marketing of AIFs to retail investors, the risks and rewards of purchasing units or shares of an AIF in an equally prominent manner and whether all information in the marketing communications is presented in a manner that is fair, clear and not misleading. That verification should be performed within a limited timeframe. Where competent authorities require prior notification, this should not prevent them from verifying marketing communications ex-post.
Competent authorities should report to ESMA the results of those verifications, requests for amendments and any sanctions imposed on managers of collective investment undertakings. With a view to increasing awareness and transparency on the rules applicable to marketing communications, on the one hand, and ensuring investor protection, on the other hand, ESMA should every second year prepare and send to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission a report on those rules and their practical application on the basis of ex-ante and ex-post verifications of marketing communications by competent authorities.
In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), certain companies and persons referred to in Article 32 of that Regulation are exempt from the obligations under that Regulation until 31 December 2019. That Regulation also provides that the Commission is to review it by 31 December 2018, in order to assess, inter alia, whether that transitional exemption should be prolonged, or whether, following the identification of any necessary adjustments, the provisions on key investor information in Directive 2009/65/EC should be replaced by or considered equivalent to the key information document as laid down in that Regulation.
The Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing technical standards, developed by ESMA, with regard to the standard forms, templates and procedures for publication and notification by competent authorities of the national laws, regulations and administrative provisions and their summaries on marketing requirements applicable in their territories, the levels of fees or charges levied by them for cross-border activities, and, where applicable, relevant calculation methodologies. Furthermore, to improve the transmission to ESMA, implementing technical standards should also be adopted with respect to notifications, notification letters and information on cross-border marketing activities that are required by Directives 2009/65/EC and 2011/61/EU and the technical arrangements necessary for the functioning of the notification portal to be established by ESMA. The Commission should adopt those implementing technical standards by means of implementing acts pursuant to Article 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
Any processing of personal data carried out within the framework of this Regulation, such as the exchange or transmission of personal data by the competent authorities, should be undertaken in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10), and any exchange or transmission of information by ESMA should be undertaken in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11).
By 2 August 2024, the Commission should conduct an evaluation of the application of this Regulation. The evaluation should take account of market developments and assess whether the measures introduced have improved the cross-border distribution of collective investment undertakings.
This Regulation establishes uniform rules on the publication of national provisions concerning marketing requirements for collective investment undertakings and on marketing communications addressed to investors, as well as common principles concerning fees and charges levied on managers of collective investment undertakings in relation to their cross-border activities. It also provides for the establishment of a central database on the cross-border marketing of collective investment undertakings.
This Regulation shall apply to:
For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions apply:
3.

4.   AIFMs, EuVECA managers and EuSEF managers shall ensure that marketing communications comprising an invitation to purchase units or shares of an AIF that contain specific information about an AIF do not contradict the information which is to be disclosed to the investors in accordance with Article 23 of Directive 2011/61/EU, with Article 13 of Regulation (EU) No 345/2013 or with Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 346/2013, or diminish its significance.
5.
