REGULATION (EU) 2019/1020 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
on market surveillance and compliance of products and amending Directive 2004/42/EC and Regulations (EC) No 765/2008 and (EU) No 305/2011
The framework for market surveillance established by this Regulation should complement and strengthen existing provisions in Union harmonisation legislation relating to the ensuring of compliance of products and the framework for cooperation with organisations representing economic operators or end users, the market surveillance of products and controls on those products entering the Union market. However, in accordance with the principle of lex specialis, this Regulation should apply only in so far as there are no specific provisions with the same objective, nature or effect in Union harmonisation legislation. The corresponding provisions of this Regulation should therefore not apply in the areas covered by such specific provisions, for instance those set out in Regulations (EC) No 1223/2009 (3), (EU) 2017/745 (4) and (EU) 2017/746 (5), including as regards the use of the European database on medical devices (EUDAMED), and (EU) 2018/858 (6) of the European Parliament and of the Council.
Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) lays down the general safety requirements for all consumer products and provides for specific obligations and powers of the Member States in relation to dangerous products as well as for the exchange of information to that effect through the Rapid Information Exchange System (RAPEX). Market surveillance authorities should have the possibility of taking the more specific measures available to them under that Directive. In order to achieve a higher level of safety for consumer products, the mechanisms for exchanges of information and rapid intervention situations provided for in Directive 2001/95/EC should be made more effective.
The provisions on market surveillance of this Regulation should cover products that are subject to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I concerning manufactured products other than food, feed, medicinal products for human and veterinary use, living plants and animals, products of human origin and products of plants and animals relating directly to their future reproduction. This will ensure a uniform framework for market surveillance of those products at Union level and will help to increase the confidence of consumers and other end users in products placed on the Union market. If new Union harmonisation legislation is adopted in the future, it will be for that legislation to specify whether this Regulation is also to apply to that legislation.
Articles 15 to 29 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) laying down the Community market surveillance framework and controls of products entering the Community market should be deleted and the respective provisions should be replaced by this Regulation. That framework includes the provisions on controls of products entering the Community market, in Articles 27, 28 and 29 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, which apply not only to products covered by the market surveillance framework, but to all products in so far as other Union law does not contain specific provisions relating to the organisation of controls on products entering the Union market. It is therefore necessary that the scope of the provisions of this Regulation with regard to products entering the Union market extend to all products.
Responsibility for enforcing Union harmonisation legislation should lie with the Member States, and their market surveillance authorities should be required to ensure that the legislation is fully complied with. The Member States should, therefore, establish systematic approaches to ensure effectiveness of market surveillance and other enforcement activities. In this regard, the methodology and criteria for assessing risks should be further harmonised in all Member States in order to ensure a level playing field for all economic operators.
Certain definitions currently set out in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 should be aligned with definitions set out in other Union legal acts and, where appropriate, reflect the architecture of modern supply chains. The definition of ‘manufacturer’ in this Regulation should not relieve manufacturers of any obligations they might have under Union harmonisation legislation where specific definitions of manufacturer are applied, which might cover any natural or legal person who modifies a product already placed on the market in such a way that compliance with the applicable Union harmonisation legislation might be affected and places it on the market, or any other natural or legal person who places a product on the market under its name or trade mark.
Economic operators throughout the entire supply chain should be expected to act responsibly and in full accordance with the legal requirements applicable when placing or making products available on the market, so as to ensure compliance with the Union harmonisation legislation on products. This Regulation should be without prejudice to the obligations corresponding to the roles of each of the economic operators in the supply and distribution process pursuant to specific provisions in Union harmonisation legislation, and the manufacturer should retain ultimate responsibility for compliance of the product with requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation.
Modern supply chains encompass a wide variety of economic operators who should all be subject to enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation, while taking due consideration of their respective roles in the supply chain, and the extent to which they contribute to the making available of products on the Union market. Therefore, it is necessary to apply this Regulation to economic operators that are directly concerned by Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I to this Regulation, such as the producer of an article and the downstream user as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) and in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10), the installer as defined in Directive 2014/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (11), the supplier as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) or the dealer as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13).
The obligations of the economic operator with tasks regarding products subject to certain Union harmonisation legislation should be without prejudice to existing obligations and responsibilities of manufacturer, importer and authorised representative under the relevant Union harmonisation legislation.
Obligations of this Regulation requiring an economic operator to be established in the Union in order to place products on the Union's market should only apply to areas where the need for an economic operator to act as a liaison point with the market surveillance authorities has been identified, taking into account a risk-based approach, having regard to the principle of proportionality, and taking into account high level of protection of end users in the Union.
Moreover, those obligations should not apply where the specific requirements set out in certain legal acts on products achieve in effect the same result, namely Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16), Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17), Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18), Directive 2014/28/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (19), Directive 2014/90/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (20), Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21), Regulation (EU) 2017/745, Regulation (EU) 2017/746, Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 and Regulation (EU) 2018/858.
Consideration should also be given to situations where potential risks or cases of non-compliance are low, or in which products are mainly traded through traditional supply chains, which is the case, for instance, for Directive 2014/33/EU, Regulation (EU) 2016/424 of the European Parliament and of the Council (22) and Directive 2010/35/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (23).
Market surveillance authorities might carry out joint activities with other authorities or organisations representing economic operators or end users, with a view to promoting compliance, identifying non-compliance, raising awareness and providing guidance on Union harmonisation legislation and with respect to specific categories of products, including those that are offered for sale online.
Market surveillance should be thorough and effective, to ensure that Union harmonisation legislation on products is applied correctly. Given that controls may represent a burden for economic operators, market surveillance authorities should organise and conduct inspection activities on a risk-based approach, taking the interests of those economic operators into account and limiting the said burden to what is necessary for the performance of efficient and effective controls. Furthermore, market surveillance should be performed with the same level of care by the competent authorities of the Member State irrespective of whether non-compliance of the given product is relevant on the territory of that Member State or is likely to have an impact on the market of another Member State. Uniform conditions for certain inspection activities carried out by the market surveillance authorities where products or categories of products present specific risks or seriously breach the applicable Union harmonisation legislation might be laid down by the Commission.
In order to ensure that the Union harmonisation legislation on products is correctly enforced, market surveillance authorities should have a common set of investigative and enforcement powers, allowing for enhanced cooperation between market surveillance authorities and more effective deterrence for economic operators that willingly infringe Union harmonisation legislation. Those powers should be sufficiently robust to tackle the enforcement challenges of Union harmonisation legislation, along with the challenges of e-commerce and the digital environment and to prevent economic operators from exploiting gaps in the enforcement system by relocating to Member States whose market surveillance authorities are not equipped to tackle unlawful practices. In particular, the powers should ensure that information and evidence can be exchanged between competent authorities so that enforcement can be undertaken equally in all Member States.
This Regulation should be without prejudice to the freedom of Member States to choose the enforcement system that they consider to be appropriate. Member States should be free to choose whether their market surveillance authorities can exercise investigation and enforcement directly under their own authority, by recourse to other public authorities or upon application to the competent courts.
Market surveillance authorities should have access to all necessary evidence, data and information relating to the subject matter of an investigation in order to determine whether applicable Union harmonisation legislation has been infringed, and in particular to identify the economic operator responsible, irrespective of who possesses the evidence, data or information in question and regardless of where it is located and of the format in which it is held. Market surveillance authorities should be able to request economic operators, including those in the digital value chain, to provide all the evidence, data and information necessary.
Market surveillance authorities should be able to check the compliance of products to be made available on the market with Union harmonisation legislation and to obtain evidence of non-compliance. They should, therefore, have the power to acquire products and, where the evidence cannot be obtained by other means, to purchase products under a cover identity.
The implementation of this Regulation and the exercise of powers in its application should also comply with other Union and national law, for example Directive 2000/31/EC, including with applicable procedural safeguards and principles of the fundamental rights. That implementation and that exercise of powers should also be proportionate and adequate in view of the nature and the overall actual or potential harm caused by the infringement. Competent authorities should take all facts and circumstances of the case into account and should choose the most appropriate measures, namely, those which are essential to address the infringement covered by this Regulation. Those measures should be proportionate, effective and dissuasive. Member States should remain free to set out conditions and limits for the exercise of the powers to fulfil duties in national law. Where, for example, in accordance with national law, prior authorisation to enter the premises of natural persons and legal persons is required from the judicial authority of the Member State concerned, the power to enter such premises should be used only after such prior authorisation has been obtained.
Market surveillance authorities act in the interest of economic operators, of end users, and of the public, to ensure that public interests covered by relevant Union harmonisation legislation on products are consistently preserved and protected through appropriate enforcement measures, and that compliance with such legislation is ensured across the supply chain through appropriate checks, taking into consideration the fact that administrative checks alone, in many cases, cannot replace physical and laboratory checks in order to verify the compliance of products with the relevant Union harmonisation legislation. Consequently, market surveillance authorities should ensure a high level of transparency while performing their activities and should make available to the public any information that they consider to be relevant in order to protect the interests of end users in the Union.
This Regulation should be without prejudice to the safeguard clause procedure provided for by sectoral Union harmonisation legislation, pursuant to Article 114(10) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. With a view to ensuring an equivalent level of protection throughout the Union, Member States are authorised to take measures in relation to products presenting a risk to health and safety, or other aspects of public interest protection. They are also required to notify those measures to other Member States and the Commission, allowing the Commission to take a position on whether national measures that restrict the free movement of products with a view to ensuring the functioning of the internal market are justified.
It is appropriate that Member States designate the authorities responsible for applying the customs legislation and any other authorities in charge under national law of control on products entering the Union market.
An effective way to ensure that unsafe or non-compliant products are not placed on the Union market would be to detect such products before they are released for free circulation. Authorities in charge of the control on products entering the Union market have a complete overview of trade flows across the Union's external borders and should therefore be required to carry out adequate controls on a risk assessment basis to contribute to a safer market place which ensures a high level of protection of public interests. It is for Member States to designate the specific authorities that are to be responsible for the appropriate documentary and, where necessary, physical or laboratory checks of products before those products are released for free circulation. A uniform enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation on products can only be achieved through systematic cooperation and exchange of information between market surveillance and other authorities designated as authorities in charge of the control on products entering the Union market. These authorities should receive well in advance from the market surveillance authorities all the necessary information concerning non-compliant products or information on economic operators where a higher risk of non-compliance has been identified. In turn, authorities in charge of the control on products entering the customs territory of the Union should inform the market surveillance authorities in a timely manner of the release of products for free circulation, and the results of controls, where such information is relevant for the enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation on products. Furthermore, where the Commission becomes aware of a serious risk presented by an imported product, it should inform the Member States about that risk in order to ensure coordinated and more effective compliance and enforcement controls at the first points of entry to the Union.
Importers should be reminded that Articles 220, 254, 256, 257 and 258 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (28) provide that products entering the Union market that require further processing in order to be in compliance with the applicable Union harmonisation legislation shall be placed under the appropriate customs procedure allowing such processing by the importer. Generally, the release for free circulation should not be deemed to be proof of conformity with Union law, since such a release does not necessarily include a complete check of compliance.
The Commission should be able to exchange market surveillance related information with regulatory authorities of third countries or international organisations within the framework of agreements concluded between the Union and third countries or international organisations, with a view to ensuring compliance of products prior to their export to the Union market.
In order to achieve a high degree of compliance with applicable Union harmonisation legislation on products while at the same time ensuring an effective resource-allocation and a cost-efficient control of products entering the Union market, the Commission should be able to approve specific pre-export control systems. Products falling under such approved systems might, as part of the risk assessment performed by authorities in charge of controls on products entering the Union market, benefit from a higher level of confidence than comparable products which have not been subject to a pre-export control.
The Commission should carry out an evaluation of this Regulation in light of the objective it pursues, and taking into consideration new technological, economic, commercial and legal developments. Pursuant to point 22 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better L aw Making (29), the evaluation, based on efficiency, effectiveness, relevance, coherence and value added, should provide the basis for impact assessments of options for further action, particularly as regards the scope of this Regulation, the application and enforcement of the provisions related to the tasks of economic operators placing products on the market, and the system of product-related pre-export controls.
In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in relation to: determining the uniform conditions for checks, criteria for determination of the frequency of checks and amount of samples to be checked in relation to certain products or categories of products, where specific risks or serious breaches of Union harmonisation legislation have been continuously identified; specifying the procedures for the designation of Union testing facilities; laying down benchmarks and techniques for checks on the basis of common risk analysis at the Union level; specifying the details of statistical data covering controls performed by the designated authorities with respect to products subject to Union law; specifying the details of implementation arrangements for the information and communication system and defining the data relating to the placing of products under the customs procedure ‘release for free circulation’ transmitted by customs authorities; and to the approval of specific systems of product-related pre-export controls and the withdrawal of such approvals. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (30).
Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to improve the functioning of the internal market by strengthening the market surveillance of products covered by Union harmonisation legislation, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States given the need for a very high degree of cooperation, interaction and coherent action of all of the competent authorities in all Member States, but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
1.   The objective of this Regulation is to improve the functioning of the internal market by strengthening the market surveillance of products covered by the Union harmonisation legislation referred to in Article 2, with a view to ensuring that only compliant products that fulfil requirements providing a high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety in general, health and safety in the workplace, the protection of consumers, the protection of the environment and public security and any other public interests protected by that legislation, are made available on the Union market.
2.   This Regulation lays down rules and procedures for economic operators regarding products subject to certain Union harmonisation legislation and establishes a framework for cooperation with economic operators.
3.   This Regulation also provides a framework for controls on products entering the Union market.
1.   This Regulation shall apply to products that are subject to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I (‘Union harmonisation legislation’), in so far as there are no specific provisions with the same objective in the Union harmonisation legislation, which regulate in a more specific manner particular aspects of market surveillance and enforcement.
3.   The application of this Regulation shall not prevent market surveillance authorities from taking more specific measures as provided for in Directive 2001/95/EC.
For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:
Tasks of economic operators regarding products subject to certain Union harmonisation legislation
1.   Notwithstanding any obligations set out in applicable Union harmonisation legislation, a product subject to legislation referred to in paragraph 5 may be placed on the market only if there is an economic operator established in the Union who is responsible for the tasks set out in paragraph 3 in respect of that product.
if the Union harmonisation legislation applicable to the product provides for an EU declaration of conformity or declaration of performance and technical documentation, verifying that the EU declaration of conformity or declaration of performance and technical documentation have been drawn up, keeping the declaration of conformity or declaration of performance at the disposal of market surveillance authorities for the period required by that legislation and ensuring that the technical documentation can be made available to those authorities upon request;
cooperating with the market surveillance authorities, including following a reasoned request making sure that the immediate, necessary, corrective action is taken to remedy any case of non-compliance with the requirements set out in Union harmonisation legislation applicable to the product in question, or, if that is not possible, to mitigate the risks presented by that product, when required to do so by the market surveillance authorities or on its own initiative, where the economic operator referred to in paragraph 1 considers or has reason to believe that the product in question presents a risk.
5.   This Article only applies in relation to products that are subject to Regulations (EU) No 305/2011 (34), (EU) 2016/425 (35) and (EU) 2016/426 (36) of the European Parliament and of the Council, and Directives 2000/14/EC (37), 2006/42/EC (38), 2009/48/EC (39), 2009/125/EC (40), 2011/65/EU (41), 2013/29/EU (42), 2013/53/EU (43), 2014/29/EU (44), 2014/30/EU (45), 2014/31/EU (46), 2014/32/EU (47), 2014/34/EU (48), 2014/35/EU (49), 2014/53/EU (50) and 2014/68/EU (51) of the European Parliament and of the Council.
2.   The authorised representative shall perform the tasks specified in the mandate. It shall provide a copy of the mandate to the market surveillance authorities upon request, in a Union language determined by the market surveillance authority.
1.   Economic operators shall cooperate with market surveillance authorities regarding actions which could eliminate or mitigate risks that are presented by products made available on the market by those operators.
2.   Member States shall put in place procedures for providing economic operators, at their request and free of charge, with information with respect to the national transposition and implementation of Union harmonisation legislation applicable to products. For this purpose, Article 9(1), (4) and (5) of Regulation (EU) 2019/515 shall apply.
1.   Market surveillance authorities may agree with other relevant authorities or with organisations representing economic operators or end users on the carrying out of joint activities that have the aim of promoting compliance, identifying non-compliance, raising awareness and providing guidance in relation to the Union harmonisation legislation with respect to specific categories of products, in particular categories of products that are often found to present a serious risk, including products offered for sale online.
2.   The market surveillance authority in question and the parties referred to in paragraph 1 shall ensure that the agreement on joint activities does not lead to unfair competition between economic operators and does not affect the objectivity, independence and impartiality of the parties.
4.   The market surveillance authority in question shall make the agreement on joint activities, including the names of the parties involved, available to the public and shall enter that agreement in the information and communication system referred to in Article 34. At the request of a Member State, the Network established under Article 29 shall assist in the drawing up of the agreement on joint activities.
1.   Member States shall organise and carry out market surveillance as provided for in this Regulation.
2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, each Member State shall designate one or more market surveillance authorities in its territory. Each Member State shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of its market surveillance authorities and the areas of competence of each of those authorities, using the information and communication system referred to in Article 34.
6.   Where there is more than one market surveillance authority in their territory, Member States shall ensure that the respective duties of those authorities are clearly defined and that appropriate communication and coordination mechanisms are established to enable those authorities to collaborate closely and exercise their duties effectively.
1.   Market surveillance authorities shall conduct their activities in order to ensure the following:
effective market surveillance within their territory of products made available online and offline with respect to products that are subject to Union harmonisation legislation;
the taking by economic operators of appropriate and proportionate corrective action in relation to compliance with that legislation and this Regulation;
3.   Market surveillance authorities, as part of their activities set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, shall perform appropriate checks on the characteristics of products on an adequate scale, by means of documentary checks and, where appropriate, physical and laboratory checks based on adequate samples, prioritising their resources and actions to ensure effective market surveillance and taking into account the national market surveillance strategy referred to in Article 13.
4.   The Commission, after consulting the Network, may adopt implementing acts determining the uniform conditions of checks, criteria for determination of the frequency of checks and amount of samples to be checked in relation to certain products or categories of products, where specific risks or serious breaches of applicable Union harmonisation legislation have been continuously identified, in order to ensure high level of protection of health and safety or other public interests protected by that legislation. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 43(2).
5.   Where economic operators present test reports or certificates attesting the conformity of their products with Union harmonisation legislation issued by a conformity assessment body accredited in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, market surveillance authorities shall take due account of those reports or certificates.
7.   Market surveillance authorities shall establish the following procedures in connection with products subject to the Union harmonisation legislation:
9.   Without prejudice to any Union safeguard procedure pursuant to the applicable Union harmonisation legislation, products that have been deemed to be non-compliant on the basis of a decision of a market surveillance authority in one Member State shall be presumed to be non-compliant by market surveillance authorities in other Member States, unless a relevant market surveillance authority in another Member State concluded the contrary on the basis of its own investigation, taking into account the input, if any, provided by an economic operator.
an assessment of the cooperation with market surveillance authorities in other Member States, as referred to in Article 11(8) and Chapter VI.
3.   Member States shall communicate their national market surveillance strategy to the Commission and other Member States through the information and communication system referred to in Article 34. Each Member State shall publish a summary of its strategy.
1.   Member States shall confer on their market surveillance authorities the powers of market surveillance, investigation and enforcement necessary for the application of this Regulation and for the application of Union harmonisation legislation.
2.   Market surveillance authorities shall exercise the powers set out in this Article efficiently and effectively, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, to the extent that such exercise relates to the subject matter and the purpose of the measures and the nature and the overall actual or potential harm resulting from the instance of non-compliance. Powers shall be conferred and exercised in accordance with Union and national law, including the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, as well as with principles of national law relating to freedom of expression and the freedom and pluralism of the media, with applicable procedural safeguards and with the Union rules on data protection, in particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
4.   The powers conferred on market surveillance authorities under paragraph 1 shall include at least the following:
the power to require economic operators to provide relevant documents, technical specifications, data or information on compliance and technical aspects of the product, including access to embedded software in so far as such access is necessary for the purpose of assessing the product's compliance with applicable Union harmonisation legislation, in any form or format and irrespective of the medium of storage or the place where such documents, technical specifications, data or information are stored, and to take or obtain copies thereof;
the power to require economic operators to provide relevant information on the supply chain, on the details of the distribution network, on quantities of products on the market and on other product models that have the same technical characteristics as the product in question, where relevant for compliance with the applicable requirements under Union harmonisation legislation;
1.   Member States may authorise their market surveillance authorities to reclaim from the relevant economic operator the totality of the costs of their activities with respect to instances of non-compliance.
1.   Market surveillance authorities shall take appropriate measures if a product subject to Union harmonisation legislation, when used in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions which can be reasonably foreseen and when properly installed and maintained:
2.   Where market surveillance authorities make findings referred to in point (a) or (b) of paragraph 1, they shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take appropriate and proportionate corrective action to bring the non-compliance to an end or to eliminate the risk within a period they specify.
bringing the product into compliance, including by rectifying formal non-compliance as defined by the applicable Union harmonisation legislation, or by ensuring that the product no longer presents a risk;
5.   If the economic operator fails to take corrective action referred to in paragraph 3 or where the non-compliance or the risk referred to in paragraph 1 persists, market surveillance authorities shall ensure that the product is withdrawn or recalled, or that its being made available on the market is prohibited or restricted, and that the public, the Commission and the other Member States are informed accordingly.
6.   The information to the Commission and the other Member States pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article shall be communicated through the information and communication system referred to in Article 34. That communication of information shall also be deemed to fulfil notification requirements for the applicable safeguard procedures of Union harmonisation legislation.
7.   Where a national measure is considered to be justified in accordance with the applicable safeguard procedure, or where no market surveillance authority of another Member State concluded the contrary as referred to in Article 11(9), the competent market surveillance authorities in the other Member States shall take the necessary measures in respect of the non-compliant product and shall enter the relevant information in the information and communication system referred to in Article 34.
1.   Any measure, decision or order taken or made by market surveillance authorities pursuant to Union harmonisation legislation or this Regulation shall state the exact grounds on which it is based.
2.   Any such measure, decision or order shall be communicated without delay to the relevant economic operator, who shall at the same time be informed of the remedies available to it under the law of the Member State concerned and of the time limits to which those remedies are subject.
1.   Market surveillance authorities shall ensure that products presenting a serious risk are withdrawn or recalled, where there is no other effective means available to eliminate the serious risk, or that their being made available on the market is prohibited. Market surveillance authorities shall notify the Commission thereof immediately, in accordance with Article 20.
1.   Where a market surveillance authority takes or intends to take a measure pursuant to Article 19 and considers that the reasons which prompted the measure or the effects of the measure go beyond the territory of its Member State, it shall immediately notify the Commission of that measure in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article. The market surveillance authority shall also inform the Commission without delay of the modification or withdrawal of any such measure.
carry out testing of products at the request of market surveillance authorities, the Network or the Commission;
1.   There shall be efficient cooperation and exchange of information among the market surveillance authorities of the Member States, and between market surveillance authorities and the Commission and the relevant Union agencies.
1.   Where bringing non-compliance with regard to a product to an end requires measures within the jurisdiction of another Member State and where such measures do not result from the requirements of Article 16(7), an applicant authority may submit a duly reasoned request for enforcement measures to a requested authority in that other Member State.
Controls on products entering the Union market
3.   Products subject to Union law that are to be placed under the customs procedure ‘release for free circulation’ shall be subject to controls performed by the authorities designated under paragraph 1 of this Article. They shall perform those controls on the basis of risk analysis in accordance with Articles 46 and 47 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 and, where relevant, on the basis of risk-based approach as referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 11(3) of this Regulation.
the authorities designated under paragraph 1 of this Article in accordance with Article 47(2) of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013; and
customs authorities in accordance with Article 46(5) of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013.
5.   Market surveillance authorities shall provide authorities designated under paragraph 1 with information on categories of products or the identity of economic operators where a higher risk of non-compliance has been identified.
6.   By 31 March of each year, Member States shall submit to the Commission detailed statistical data covering controls performed by the authorities designated under paragraph 1 with respect to products subject to Union law during the previous calendar year. The statistical data shall cover the number of interventions in the field of controls on such products with regard to product safety and compliance.
7.   Where the Commission becomes aware of a serious risk presented by products subject to Union law that are imported from a third country, it shall recommend to the Member State concerned to take appropriate market surveillance measures.
8.   The Commission, after consulting the Network, may adopt implementing acts laying down benchmarks and techniques for checks on the basis of common risk analysis on the Union level, in order to ensure a consistent enforcement of Union law, to strengthen the controls on products entering the Union market and to ensure an effective and uniform level of such controls. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 43(2).
1.   Authorities designated under Article 25(1) shall suspend the release of a product for free circulation if in the course of controls pursuant to Article 25(3), it is established that:
3.   Where the market surveillance authorities have reasonable grounds to believe that a product does not comply with the Union law applicable to it or presents a serious risk, they shall request the authorities designated under Article 25(1) to suspend the process for its release for free circulation.
1.   Where the market surveillance authorities conclude that a product presents a serious risk, they shall take measures to prohibit the placing of the product on the market and shall require the authorities designated under Article 25(1) not to release it for free circulation. They shall also require these authorities to include the following notice in the customs data-processing system, and, where appropriate, on the commercial invoice accompanying the product and on any other relevant accompanying document:
2.   Where market surveillance authorities conclude that a product may not be placed on the market since it does not comply with the Union law applicable to it, they shall take measures to prohibit the placing of the product on the market and shall require the authorities designated under Article 25(1) not to release it for free circulation. They shall also require those authorities to include the following notice in the customs data-processing system, and, where appropriate, on the commercial invoice accompanying the product and on any other relevant accompanying document:
