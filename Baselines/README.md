## Baseline Experiments

We generally group the experiments into two broader categories:

1. Monolingual summarization, and
2. Cross-lingual summarization

The experimental code for the latter can be entirely found in the `cross_lingual_baselines/` folder.
However, it should be noted that the cross-lingual baseline scripts require the existence of source files at the current level,
which will be generated by `extract_sample_files_summaries.py`.


#### `dump.txt`
This file contains result outputs for the monolingual experiments, which are also present in the paper.

#### `extract_sample_files_summaries.py`
Generates summaries for the samples included in the original EMNLP code submission. This includes 2 samples from each split.

#### `LexRank.py`
Adapted example from the SentenceTransformers repository, implementing a basic LexRank summarizer.

#### `lexrank_baselines.py`
Generates monolingual paragraph-based summaries using a modified version of LexRank, which utilizes SentenceTransformers multilingual embeddings for the centrality computation.
